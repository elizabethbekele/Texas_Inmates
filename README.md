# Texas_Inmates
Statistical Analysis on the average years sentenced for those who were committed for either aggravated robbery or murder in a Texas correctional facility.

This analysis will focus on looking at three factors - gender, race, and age - to see if they are influential in the length an inmate was sentenced. This analysis was for strictly educational purposes and we acknowledge that there are other components that are considered when a sentencing is given to a defendant. The dataset does not take into account priors the inmate may or may not have. 

Statistical methods used in the analysis include: 

- Interval Estimation
- Hypothesis Testing
- Bootstrapping
- Permutation
- ANOVA

The full data set at the time of conducting this analyses will be included along with the subset that was analyzed.
